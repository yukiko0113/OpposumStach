# Israh Theme for Jekyll

Israh is a responsive Jekyll theme with warm greys, a single column layout, and not much else.

This theme is an evolution of my [Ezora jekyll theme](https://github.com/ezrasavard/ezora-jekyll-theme) that reflects my own changing tastes.
Most notably, Israh takes the focus off of header images so I don't have to find them for posts that don't need them.

### [Try Israh](https://ezrasavard.github.io/israh-jekyll-theme)

Feel free to use this theme however you like (MIT License).

## Installation

Just fork this repository and add your own content =).

## Usage

Like Ezora, Israh uses a fairly minimal set of layouts and sass. Width/height values are all defined in the top of css/main.scss as variables, so you don't have to hunt too far through the SCSS to tweak things.

The navigation menu is generated from the list of links in _config.yml.
